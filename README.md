# Employee-Turnover-Predictive-Audit
Advanced HR Analytics study using regression modeling to identify the "6-Year Turnover Cliff." This project isolates statistical "signals" over compensation "noise" to propose data-driven mobility strategies.

Executive Summary: The 6-Year Cliff - This project provides a predictive audit of employee turnover, challenging the traditional assumption that compensation is the primary driver of retention. By analyzing a synthetic organizational dataset for MGMT 595 at Montclair State University, this study identifies a critical "6-Year Cliff" where institutional memory is at its highest risk of being lost due to role stagnation. The core finding reveals that we are often treating a stagnation problem with salary solutions when the data proves that movement matters more than money.

Key Insights: Signal vs. Noise - The analysis reveals a clear distinction between common HR assumptions and actual statistical drivers of attrition. Regarding the "Noise," annual salary and market-competitive compa-ratios demonstrated no statistical impact on employee retention. Finding that we cannot buy our way out of this crisis, the study focuses instead on "The Signal". Job tenure risk increases every year an employee remains in the same role, and a lack of promotion speed serves as the strongest predictor of loss. Specifically, the "6-Year Cliff" shows that turnover probability remains manageable under 30% for the first four years but doubles to 58% at year six. By year ten, the probability of an exit hits a staggering 86%.

Regional Hotspot: The Southwest Crisis - A deep dive into the Southwest region reveals the highest turnover probability in the company at 51%. This "Perfect Storm" is driven by a combination of role stagnation in the Products Unit and logistical friction, as travel time was identified as the primary statistical driver of these exits. This highlights that retention strategies cannot be one-size-fits-all and must address regional logistical burdens to prevent further talent drain.

Strategic Recommendations - To reset the risk clock and maintain a fluid internal market, this audit proposes a three-pronged pilot program. First, mandatory "Stay" interviews and career-mapping sessions will be conducted at the 3-year mark to intervene before the 6-year stagnation spike. Second, a Southwest Hybrid-Flex pilot will offer a 2-day remote work option to neutralize travel-time friction. Finally, a lateral rotation program in the Products Unit will allow subject matter experts to rotate into new functions, providing a psychological "reset" that dramatically lowers exit probability without requiring an immediate promotion.
